# LunaCoreAPI
A mod library containing functions that expand LunaCore's core functionality. Its goal is to make it easier for developers to create their own mods using LunaCore by providing utilities that automatically handle internal core functions to avoid inconsistencies that could occur when working with them manually.

The API is still being worked on and currently only contains functions for adding simple custom items to the game.

The code can change drastically between versions which could break mods that use it.

Because it works as a mod, it will not necessarily be updated at the same time as LunaCore
